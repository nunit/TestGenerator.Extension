# NUnit Visual Studio Test Generator

This is an extension for Visual Studio that extends
the test functionality to allow you to create unit tests and IntelliTests.
It works for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019. 
The extension extends the built in test generator functionality allowing
developers to generate tests using NUnit 2.7.x or NUnit 3.x.

Please note that IntelliTest is only available in Visual

only have the `Create Unit Tests` menu option.

Also note that there are seperate versions for VS 2015 and VS 2017/2019
